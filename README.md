# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Somehow I lost my first README.md and this is my second go but it's good because I refactored a little much to of the html and css the point where I probably broke something.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

I tried to adhere to the Scout Rule: 

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

I tried to reduce the redundancies 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I think my code follows accessibility standards, mostly...
Our site is now optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Review

I hope I don't forget this part:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
